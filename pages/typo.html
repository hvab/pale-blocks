      <h1>Johannes Gutenberg: The Birth of&nbsp;Movable Type</h1>
      <p>German inventor Johannes Gutenberg developed a&nbsp;method of&nbsp;movable type and used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;create one of&nbsp;the western world’s first major printed books, the “Forty—Two—Line” Bible.</p>
      <p><strong>Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg</strong> (c.&nbsp;1398&nbsp;– 1468) was a&nbsp;German blacksmith, goldsmith, printer, and publisher who introduced printing to&nbsp;Europe. His invention of&nbsp;mechanical movable type printing started the Printing Revolution and is&nbsp;widely regarded as&nbsp;the most important event of&nbsp;the modern period. It&nbsp;played a&nbsp;key role in&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg">Enlightenment</a>, and the <a href="test">Scientific revolution</a> and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of&nbsp;learning to&nbsp;the masses.</p>
      <p>With his invention of&nbsp;the printing press, Gutenberg was the first European to&nbsp;use movable type printing, in&nbsp;around 1439. Among his many contributions to&nbsp;printing are: the invention of&nbsp;a&nbsp;process for mass-producing movable type; the use of&nbsp;oil-based ink; and the use of&nbsp;a&nbsp;wooden printing press similar to&nbsp;the agricultural screw presses of&nbsp;the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of&nbsp;these elements into a&nbsp;practical system that allowed the mass production of&nbsp;printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg’s method for making type is&nbsp;traditionally considered to&nbsp;have included a&nbsp;type metal alloy and a&nbsp;hand mould for casting type. The alloy was a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;lead, tin, and antimony that melted at&nbsp;a&nbsp;relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a&nbsp;durable type.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;Renaissance Europe, the arrival of&nbsp;mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of&nbsp;mass communication which permanently altered the structure of&nbsp;society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of&nbsp;information&nbsp;– including revolutionary ideas&nbsp;– transcended borders, captured the masses in&nbsp;the Reformation and threatened the power of&nbsp;political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in&nbsp;literacy broke the monopoly of&nbsp;the literate elite on&nbsp;education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of&nbsp;its people led to&nbsp;the rise of&nbsp;proto-nationalism, accelerated by&nbsp;the flowering of&nbsp;the European vernacular languages to&nbsp;the detriment of&nbsp;Latin’s status as&nbsp;lingua franca. In&nbsp;the 19th century, the replacement of&nbsp;the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by&nbsp;steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on&nbsp;an&nbsp;industrial scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.</p>
      <p>The use of&nbsp;movable type was a&nbsp;marked improvement on&nbsp;the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of&nbsp;book production in&nbsp;Europe, and upon woodblock printing, and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg’s printing technology spread rapidly throughout Europe and later the world.</p>
      <p>His major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as&nbsp;the <nobr>42-line</nobr> Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.</p>
      <h2>Printing Press</h2>
      <p>Around 1439, Gutenberg was involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;financial misadventure making polished metal mirrors (which were believed to&nbsp;capture holy light from religious relics) for sale to&nbsp;pilgrims to&nbsp;Aachen: in&nbsp;1439 the city was planning to&nbsp;exhibit its collection of&nbsp;relics from Emperor Charlemagne but the event was delayed by&nbsp;one year due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;severe flood and the capital already spent could not be&nbsp;repaid. When the question of&nbsp;satisfying the investors came&nbsp;up, Gutenberg is&nbsp;said to&nbsp;have promised to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;“secret”. It&nbsp;has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of&nbsp;printing with movable type. Also around <nobr>1439–1440,</nobr> the Dutch Laurens Janszoon Coster came up&nbsp;with the idea of&nbsp;printing. Legend has it&nbsp;that the idea came to&nbsp;him “like a&nbsp;ray of&nbsp;light”.</p>
      <p>Until at&nbsp;least 1444&nbsp;he lived in&nbsp;Strasbourg, most likely in&nbsp;the St. Arbogast parish. It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;Strasbourg in&nbsp;1440 that Gutenberg is&nbsp;said to&nbsp;have perfected and unveiled the secret of&nbsp;printing based on&nbsp;his research, mysteriously entitled Kunst und Aventur (art and enterprise). It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not clear what work he&nbsp;was engaged&nbsp;in, or&nbsp;whether some early trials with printing from movable type may have been conducted there. After this, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gap of&nbsp;four years in&nbsp;the record. In&nbsp;1448, he&nbsp;was back in&nbsp;Mainz, where he&nbsp;took out a&nbsp;loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, quite possibly for a&nbsp;printing press or&nbsp;related paraphernalia. By&nbsp;this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with intaglio printing; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;claimed that he&nbsp;had worked on&nbsp;copper engravings with an&nbsp;artist known as&nbsp;the Master of&nbsp;Playing Cards.</p>
      <p>By&nbsp;1450, the press was in&nbsp;operation, and a&nbsp;German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to&nbsp;be&nbsp;printed there. Gutenberg was able to&nbsp;convince the wealthy moneylender Johann Fust for a&nbsp;loan of&nbsp;800&nbsp;guilders. Peter Schöffer, who became Fust’s son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Schöffer had worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;scribe in&nbsp;Paris and is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;have designed some of&nbsp;the first typefaces.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> All that has been written to&nbsp;me&nbsp;about that marvelous man seen at&nbsp;Frankfurt is&nbsp;true. I&nbsp;have not seen complete Bibles but only a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;quires of&nbsp;various books of&nbsp;the Bible. The script was very neat and legible, not at&nbsp;all difficult to&nbsp;follow—your grace would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;read it&nbsp;without effort, and indeed without glasses. </p>
        <cite>—Future pope Pius II&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;Cardinal Carvajal, March 1455</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Gutenberg’s workshop was set up&nbsp;at&nbsp;Hof Humbrecht, a&nbsp;property belonging to&nbsp;a&nbsp;distant relative. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he&nbsp;borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in&nbsp;1452. At&nbsp;the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is&nbsp;also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of&nbsp;the profit-making enterprises of&nbsp;the new press was the printing of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;indulgences for the church, documented from <nobr>1454–55.</nobr></p>
      <p>In&nbsp;1455 Gutenberg completed his <nobr>42-line</nobr> Bible, known as&nbsp;the Gutenberg Bible. About 180 copies were printed, most on&nbsp;paper and some on&nbsp;vellum.</p>
      <h3>Court Case</h3>
      <p>Some time in&nbsp;1456, there was a&nbsp;dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of&nbsp;misusing the funds. Meanwhile the expenses of&nbsp;the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg’s debt now exceeded 20,000&nbsp;guilders. Fust sued at&nbsp;the archbishop’s court. A&nbsp;November 1455 legal document records that there was a&nbsp;partnership for a&nbsp;“project of&nbsp;the books,” the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to&nbsp;Fust. The court decided in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of&nbsp;all printed Bibles.</p>
      <p>Thus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it&nbsp;appears he&nbsp;retained (or&nbsp;re-started) a&nbsp;small printing shop, and participated in&nbsp;the printing of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Bible in&nbsp;the town of&nbsp;Bamberg around 1459, for which he&nbsp;seems at&nbsp;least to&nbsp;have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or&nbsp;a&nbsp;date, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;be&nbsp;certain, and there is&nbsp;consequently a&nbsp;considerable scholarly debate on&nbsp;this subject. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also possible that the large Catholicon dictionary, 300 copies of&nbsp;754&nbsp;pages, printed in&nbsp;Mainz in&nbsp;1460, may have been executed in&nbsp;his workshop.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Fust—Schöffer shop was the first in&nbsp;Europe to&nbsp;bring out a&nbsp;book with the printer’s name and date, the Mainz Psalter of&nbsp;August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by&nbsp;which it&nbsp;had been produced, it&nbsp;made no&nbsp;mention of&nbsp;Gutenberg.</p>
      <h3>Later Life</h3>
      <p>In&nbsp;1462, during a&nbsp;conflict between two archbishops, Mainz was sacked by&nbsp;archbishop Adolph von Nassau, and Gutenberg was exiled. An&nbsp;old man by&nbsp;now, he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;Eltville where he&nbsp;may have initiated and supervised a&nbsp;new printing press belonging to&nbsp;the brothers Bechtermünze.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;January 1465, Gutenberg’s achievements were recognized and he&nbsp;was given the title Hofmann (gentleman of&nbsp;the court) by&nbsp;von Nassau. This honor included a&nbsp;stipend, an&nbsp;annual court outfit, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;2,180 litres of&nbsp;grain and 2,000 litres of&nbsp;wine tax-free. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed he&nbsp;may have moved back to&nbsp;Mainz around this time, but this is&nbsp;not certain.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Gutenberg died in&nbsp;1468 and was buried in&nbsp;the Franciscan church at&nbsp;Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg’s grave is&nbsp;now lost.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;1504, he&nbsp;was mentioned as&nbsp;the inventor of&nbsp;typography in&nbsp;a&nbsp;book by&nbsp;Professor Ivo Wittig. It&nbsp;was not until 1567 that the first portrait of&nbsp;Gutenberg, almost certainly an&nbsp;imaginary reconstruction, appeared in&nbsp;Heinrich Pantaleon’s biography of&nbsp;famous Germans.</p>
      <h2>Printing Method With Movable Type</h2>
      <p>Gutenberg’s early printing process, and what tests he&nbsp;may have made with movable type, are not known in&nbsp;great detail. His later Bibles were printed in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way as&nbsp;to&nbsp;have required large quantities of&nbsp;type, some estimates suggesting as&nbsp;many as&nbsp;100,000 individual sorts. Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a&nbsp;day, and considering all the work in&nbsp;loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up&nbsp;the sheets, distributing the type, etc., it&nbsp;is&nbsp;thought that the Gutenberg—Fust shop might have employed as&nbsp;many as&nbsp;25&nbsp;craftsmen.</p>
      <p>Gutenberg’s technique of&nbsp;making movable type remains unclear. In&nbsp;the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in&nbsp;the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or&nbsp;a&nbsp;somewhat primitive version has been the subject of&nbsp;considerable debate.</p>
      <p>In&nbsp;the standard process of&nbsp;making type, a&nbsp;hard metal punch (made by&nbsp;punchcutting, with the letter carved back to&nbsp;front) is&nbsp;hammered into a&nbsp;softer copper bar, creating a&nbsp;matrix. This is&nbsp;then placed into a&nbsp;hand-held mould and a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;type, or&nbsp;“sort”, is&nbsp;cast by&nbsp;filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at&nbsp;once, and the resulting piece of&nbsp;type can be&nbsp;removed from the mould. The matrix can be&nbsp;reused to&nbsp;create hundreds, or&nbsp;thousands, of&nbsp;identical sorts so&nbsp;that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;distinct styles of&nbsp;typefaces or&nbsp;fonts. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type-cases, and used to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;pages which are inked and printed, a&nbsp;procedure which can be&nbsp;repeated hundreds, or&nbsp;thousands, of&nbsp;times. The sorts can be&nbsp;reused in&nbsp;any combination, earning the process the name of&nbsp;“movable type”.</p>
      <p>The invention of&nbsp;the making of&nbsp;types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to&nbsp;Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg’s process was somewhat different. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variations due to&nbsp;miscasting and inking. However, the type used in&nbsp;Gutenberg’s earliest work shows other variations.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;press, certainly, but a&nbsp;press from which shall flow in&nbsp;inexhaustible streams... Through&nbsp;it, god will spread his word.</p>
        <cite>—Johannes Gutenberg</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In&nbsp;2001, the physicist Blaise Agüera y&nbsp;Arcas and Princeton librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Papal bull in&nbsp;the Scheide Library, Princeton, to&nbsp;carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;the printed text. The irregularities in&nbsp;Gutenberg’s type, particularly in&nbsp;simple characters such as&nbsp;the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come from either ink smear or&nbsp;from wear and damage on&nbsp;the pieces of&nbsp;metal on&nbsp;the types themselves. While some identical types are clearly used on&nbsp;other pages, other variations, subjected to&nbsp;detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. Transmitted light pictures of&nbsp;the page also appeared to&nbsp;reveal substructures in&nbsp;the type that could not arise from traditional punchcutting techniques. They hypothesized that the method may have involved impressing simple shapes to&nbsp;create alphabets in&nbsp;“cuneiform” style in&nbsp;a&nbsp;matrix made of&nbsp;some soft material, perhaps sand. Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recreated to&nbsp;make each additional sort. This could explain the variations in&nbsp;the type, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the substructures observed in&nbsp;the printed images.</p>
      <p>Thus, they feel that “the decisive factor for the birth of&nbsp;typography”, the use of&nbsp;reusable moulds for casting type, might have been a&nbsp;more progressive process than was previously thought. They suggest that the additional step of&nbsp;using the punch to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;mould that could be&nbsp;reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in&nbsp;the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or&nbsp;all of&nbsp;their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in&nbsp;other ways, and the truth of&nbsp;the matter remains very uncertain.</p>
      <p>A&nbsp;1568 history by&nbsp;Hadrianus Junius of&nbsp;Holland claims that the basic idea of&nbsp;the movable type came to&nbsp;Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to&nbsp;Coster in&nbsp;the 1430s and may have brought some of&nbsp;his equipment from Haarlem to&nbsp;Mainz. While Coster appears to&nbsp;have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;evidence that he&nbsp;had actually printed anything with this technology. He&nbsp;was an&nbsp;inventor and a&nbsp;goldsmith. However, there is&nbsp;one indirect supporter of&nbsp;the claim that Coster might be&nbsp;the inventor. The author of&nbsp;the Cologne Chronicle of&nbsp;1499 quotes Ulrich Zell, the first printer of&nbsp;Cologne, that printing was performed in&nbsp;Mainz in&nbsp;1450, but that some type of&nbsp;printing of&nbsp;lower quality had previously occurred in&nbsp;the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of&nbsp;Coster, while it&nbsp;actually credits Gutenberg as&nbsp;the “first inventor of&nbsp;printing” in&nbsp;the very same passage (fol.&nbsp;312). The first securely dated book by&nbsp;Dutch printers is&nbsp;from 1471, and the Coster connection is&nbsp;today regarded as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mere legend.</p>
      <p>The 19th century printer and typefounder Fournier Le&nbsp;Jeune suggested that Gutenberg might not have been using type cast with a&nbsp;reusable matrix, but possibly wooden types that were carved individually. A&nbsp;similar suggestion was made by&nbsp;Nash in&nbsp;2004. This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven.</p>
      <p>It&nbsp;has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at&nbsp;all. In&nbsp;2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of&nbsp;the <nobr>42-line</nobr> Bible revealed an&nbsp;overlapping of&nbsp;letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in&nbsp;fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a&nbsp;system somewhat like a&nbsp;modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of&nbsp;type as&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;paper movement over pieces of&nbsp;type of&nbsp;slightly unequal height.</p>
